Pixel Pocket records daily transactions, summarises balances, breaks spending down by category, and charts it over time. Every screen is computed on-device from an embedded SQLite database (Drift), so the app works **fully offline with no account and no backend to run**. Google Sheets is supported purely as an *optional* backup target for moving data between devices.

From left to right:

- **Dashboard** — period filter, balance summary, expenses by category, recent activity
- **Transactions** — search, range filters, daily groups
- **Chart** — income vs. expense time series (`fl_chart`)
- **Settings** — salary periods, categories, backup, PIN reset
- **Unlock** — retro-terminal PIN lock, 6-attempt lockout, Forgot PIN

<sub>Balances on the dashboard are hidden behind the app's built-in privacy toggle.</sub>

## Features

| Area | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | Income / expense / balance summary, recent transactions, spending breakdown by category |
| **Transactions** | Create, edit, delete, search by description or category, and filter by date range, type, category, or salary period |
| **Categories** | Manage income and expense categories — 18 defaults seeded on first launch |
| **Salary Periods** | Group transactions by pay period instead of calendar month |
| **Chart** | Income vs. expense time series — daily for week/month ranges, monthly for a full year (`fl_chart`) |
| **Offline-first** | No network required; every summary and chart is a local Drift query |
| **Backup & Restore** | Optional Google Sheets sync — manual *Backup Now* / *Restore*, plus debounced auto-backup. A spreadsheet that already holds data prompts before anything is overwritten |
| **Security** | Local app lock via PIN — per-PIN random salt + SHA-256 in `flutter_secure_storage`, plus a destructive forgot-PIN recovery |

---

## Tech Stack

| Need | Package |
|---|---|
| State management | `flutter_riverpod` |
| Local database | `drift`, `sqlite3_flutter_libs`, `path_provider`, `path` |
| Navigation | `go_router` |
| Charts | `fl_chart` |
| Backup (optional) | `googleapis` (Sheets v4 + Drive v3), `google_sign_in` (scope `drive.file`), `http` |
| Local metadata | `shared_preferences` |
| Security | `crypto` (salted SHA-256), `flutter_secure_storage` |
| Formatting | `intl` |
| UI, fonts, icons | `google_fonts`, `pixelarticons`, `skeletonizer` |
| Launch screen & icon | `flutter_native_splash`, `flutter_launcher_icons` |

**Models are pure domain entities** — no `fromJson` / `toJson`, no `freezed`. Code generation is used *only* for Drift (`drift_dev` + `build_runner`).

---

## Architecture

Logic and UI are strictly separated. Features that own data follow four layers; the data layer is backed by Drift, so datasources are DAOs rather than HTTP clients.

```
features/<feature>/
├── data/
│   ├── datasources/       Drift DAO — queries AppDatabase, maps rows to domain models
│   └── repositories/      Thin pass-through to the DAO
├── domain/
│   └── models/            Pure entities (no Drift, no Flutter, no Riverpod)
├── application/
│   └── services/          Business logic (no Riverpod, no widgets)
└── presentation/
    ├── states/            Riverpod providers
    ├── controllers/       Riverpod glue — call services, invalidate state
    └── screens/
        └── widgets/       Widgets local to those screens
```

### Layer rules

| Layer | May use | Must not use |
|---|---|---|
| `domain/models` | Pure entities, getters | JSON, Drift, Flutter, Riverpod |
| `data/datasources` | `AppDatabase` (Drift), domain models | Riverpod state, widgets |
| `data/repositories` | Datasources, domain models, `Failure` | Drift directly, widgets |
| `application/services` | Repositories, domain models | Riverpod state, widgets |
| `presentation/states` | Riverpod, services via DI | Drift, parsing |
| `presentation/controllers` | Riverpod `Ref`, services | Drift, parsing |
| `presentation/screens` + `widgets` | Widgets, `ref.watch` | Drift, parsing, business logic |

There is no `dtos/` layer. Drift generates typed row classes from a schema we own ([tables.dart](lib/core/database/tables.dart)) rather than an external wire format, so row → domain mapping happens inline in the DAO and repositories stay pass-through. `Failure` mapping is applied only where an external SDK is involved: [auth](lib/features/auth/data/repositories/auth_repository.dart) (`google_sign_in`) and [backup](lib/features/backup/data/repositories/backup_repository.dart) (Sheets/Drive).

### Layers per feature

Not every feature needs all four layers. What each one actually carries:

| Feature | `data` | `domain` | `application` | `presentation` |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `transactions`, `categories`, `salary_period`, `chart`, `dashboard`, `auth` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `backup` | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| `settings` | — | — | — | ✓ |

Deliberate exceptions, so they are not mistaken for drift:

- **`backup` has no `domain/`.** [`backup_serialization.dart`](lib/features/backup/data/backup_serialization.dart) serialises Drift row classes directly, since a backup is a snapshot of the database rather than a business entity. For the same reason it sits at the root of `data/` instead of under `datasources/`.
- **`backup/application/auto_backup_coordinator.dart`** sits at the root of `application/` rather than in `services/`. It is a scheduler (debounce timer + dirty flag), not a business service.
- **`settings` is presentation-only.** [`settings_screen.dart`](lib/features/settings/presentation/screens/settings_screen.dart) is a composition surface — it renders widgets and controllers owned by `auth`, `backup`, `categories`, and `salary_period`, and holds no state of its own.
- **`auth` keeps widgets at `presentation/widgets/`** rather than nested under `screens/`, because `PinScaffold`, `PinDots`, and `PixelPinPad` are shared between the Set PIN and Unlock screens. Every other feature nests widgets under the screens that use them.

The rules above are also documented for contributors in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

The Drift schema (`schemaVersion` 1) holds three tables: `Categories`, `SalaryPeriods`, and `Transactions`.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK with Dart `^3.10.3`
- Android Studio or Xcode for an emulator/simulator
- Targets: Android (Flutter's default `minSdk`) and iOS 13.0+

### Install and run

```bash
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs   # generate Drift code
flutter run
```

No backend is required. On first launch the app creates the local database and seeds 18 default categories. Backup is optional and needs [its own setup](#google-cloud-setup) — every other feature works without it.

### Regenerating icon and splash

The icon's source is the pixel-art `assets/icons/A-terminal-thin.svg`. It is rendered at integer scales into `app_icon.png` (1024 px, launcher icon) and `pixel_pocket_icon_splash.png` (1152 px with the art shrunk to 832 px so it fits Android 12's circular splash mask; also used by the native and in-app splash). Run after changing either PNG or the splash colours in `pubspec.yaml`:

```bash
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
dart run flutter_native_splash:create
```

---

## Data & Backup

- **Source of truth** — the on-device Drift database. Fully usable offline, no account needed.
- **First run** — launch, set a PIN, start recording. Categories are pre-seeded.
- **Backup** — *Settings → Connect Google Sheets*, then **Backup Now**. Enable **Auto-backup** to sync after changes; it is debounced and best-effort, and never blocks a save.
- **Restore** — install on the new device and connect the same Google account. If the spreadsheet already holds data, the app asks whether to **Restore** it or **Keep Local**, and *holds auto-backup* until you answer — otherwise a debounced auto-backup could overwrite the spreadsheet with the empty local database before you ever reached Settings. Restoring replaces local data with the spreadsheet contents. Dismissing the prompt keeps the hold in place and leaves a banner in Settings.

> **Backup is a copy, not real-time sync.** Offline changes are lost on a device switch only if they were never backed up. The Settings screen surfaces the last backup time so you can tell.

### Google Cloud setup

Backup talks to Google Sheets and Drive directly using the non-sensitive `drive.file` scope, and requires **your own** Google Cloud project:

1. Enable the **Google Sheets API** and **Google Drive API**.
2. Add the `.../auth/drive.file` scope to the OAuth consent screen and publish the app to **Production**. No Google verification is needed for `drive.file`.
3. Register OAuth clients for your builds:
   - **Android** — package name plus the signing SHA-1. Use the **release** keystore SHA-1 for distributed builds.
   - **iOS** — bundle ID.
4. Point the app at your clients:
   - `AuthConfig.serverClientId` in [auth_config.dart](lib/features/auth/auth_config.dart) — replace the checked-in Web client ID.
   - `GIDClientID` in [ios/Runner/Info.plist](ios/Runner/Info.plist) — still the placeholder `IOS_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com`, so **backup does not work on iOS until this is filled in**.

> The client ID committed in `auth_config.dart` belongs to the original project. Forking this repo without replacing it will make sign-in fail or reach someone else's OAuth client. Swap it before shipping.

## Auth & Security

Routing is handled by [`go_router`](lib/core/router/app_router.dart):

```
Splash → Set PIN (first launch) / Unlock → Dashboard
                                    ↳ Forgot PIN (/reset-pin) → Set PIN
```

Google login is **not** required to use the app — the PIN is the app lock. It is never stored in plaintext: [`PinService`](lib/features/auth/application/services/pin_service.dart) derives a per-PIN random salt from `Random.secure()`, hashes `salt:pin` with SHA-256, and keeps the hash and salt in `flutter_secure_storage`. Google sign-in is requested only when connecting Google Sheets for backup.

### Forgot PIN

With no backend and no server-side identity, there is no way to prove ownership of a device without weakening the lock itself. The only recovery that does not is a full local wipe, so that is what [`ForgotPinScreen`](lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/forgot_pin_screen.dart) does: it erases every transaction, category, and salary period, reseeds the 18 defaults, clears the PIN, and disconnects Google Sheets backup (best-effort) so auto-backup cannot push the emptied database to the cloud.

The entry point is deliberately awkward — a *Forgot PIN?* link that appears only during the 30-second lockout after six wrong attempts, leading to a full screen that requires typing `DELETE`. Recovering the data afterwards means a manual **Restore** from a backup taken *before* the wipe; there is no other path.

---

## Build & Distribution

```bash
flutter build apk        # Android APK
flutter build appbundle  # Android App Bundle (Play Store)
flutter build ipa        # iOS — requires an Apple Developer account
```

For backup to work on a distributed build, register that build's **release SHA-1** in the Android OAuth client. End users then only need to install the app, set a PIN, and optionally connect their own Google account.

---

## Testing

```bash
flutter test              # unit & widget tests
flutter test --coverage   # writes coverage/lcov.info
flutter analyze           # lint
```

28 test files run entirely against an in-memory Drift database and mocked `SharedPreferences`, so no device, network, or Google account is needed:

| Scope | Covered |
|---|---|
| DAOs | Transactions, categories, salary periods, chart, summary, plus range-filter behaviour |
| Services | PIN hashing and verification, forgot-PIN reset orchestration, dashboard aggregation, auth controller |
| Backup | Serialization, restore, full-database replace, auto-backup coordinator, metadata store, the restore-decision guard, and the Settings backup card |
| Core | Database setup, full wipe, cache store, `Failure` mapping, `PixelErrorView` widget, router gating |
